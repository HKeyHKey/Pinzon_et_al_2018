# Pinzon_et_al_2018
Scripts and data for the generation of figures in Pinz√≥n et al. (2018).

1. Predicted animal proteome sequence download: directory '00_Proteome_download' (these data files will be used in the next step).

2. Search for RdRP candidates and re-sequencing of the "BL09945" RdRP locus in Branchiostoma lanceolatum: directory '01_RdRP_search' (generation of Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 1, and preparation of the sequences deposited at GenBank under accession numbers MH261373 and MH261374).

3. Phylogeny of the "eukaryotic RdRP" protein family: directory '02_RdRP_phylogeny' (generation of Figure 2).

4. Small RNA-Seq in B. lanceolatum: directory '03_Small_RNA-Seq' (classification of small RNAs into "genome-matching", "abundant non-coding RNA-matching", "pre-miRNA-matching", "transcriptome-matching, "extragenomic and extratranscriptomic" populations, to generate Figures 3, 4 and 5, Supplementary Figure 2, Supplementary Table 1, and Supplementary Data sections 1-6).

5. Analysis of prefered RdRP templates: directory '04_RdRP_template_analysis' (identification of prefered RdRP templates, comparison of their expression profiles with that of their antisense exon-exon junction-matching fragments, and that of RdRPs themselves, for Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure 4).
