Scripts and data for the generation of figures in [Pinz√≥n et al. (PLOS Genetics, 2019)](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007915 "Open-access article on journal's website").

1. Predicted animal proteome sequence download: directory '00_Proteome_download' (these data files will be used in the next step).

2. Search for RdRP candidates and re-sequencing of the "BL09945" RdRP locus in Branchiostoma lanceolatum: directory '01_RdRP_search' (generation of Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 1, and preparation of the sequences deposited at GenBank under accession numbers MH261373 and MH261374).

3. Phylogeny of the "eukaryotic RdRP" protein family: directory '02_RdRP_phylogeny' (generation of Figure 2).

4. Small RNA-Seq in B. lanceolatum: directory '03_Small_RNA-Seq' (classification of small RNAs into "genome-matching", "abundant non-coding RNA-matching", "pre-miRNA-matching", "transcriptome-matching, "extragenomic and extratranscriptomic", "exon-exon junction-matching" populations, and analysis of public C. elegans Small RNA-Seq datasets) to generate Figures 3 and 4, Supplementary Figures 2 and 3, Table 1, Supplementary Table 1, and Supplementary File S1 sections 1-6.

5. Analysis of small RNAs matching known pathogen genomes, or potential pathogens (found by contig assembly from extragenomic, extratranscriptomic reads), to generate Supplementary File S1 sections 7-15, Table 2, and Supplementary Figure 5.
